# Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Modeling

## Introduction

Leveraged Buyout (LBO) modeling is a specialized form of financial modeling used to evaluate the potential returns of acquiring a company using significant debt financing. LBO models are essential tools for private equity firms, investment banks, and corporate development teams involved in leveraged acquisitions. This section explores the principles, methodologies, and best practices for building robust LBO models.
