# Financial Statement Modeling

## Introduction

Financial statement modeling is a core skill in investment banking that involves creating a dynamic representation of a company's financial statements. This model allows analysts to forecast future performance, evaluate different scenarios, and assess the impact of strategic decisions. This section explores the principles, techniques, and applications of financial statement modeling in investment banking.

## Fundamentals of Financial Statement Modeling

Financial statement modeling integrates the three primary financial statements—income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement—into a cohesive, interconnected model that maintains the mathematical relationships between these statements.

### Key Principles

#### 1. Integration
- All three financial statements must be linked
- Changes in one statement should automatically flow through to the others
- Mathematical relationships must be maintained (e.g., net income flows to retained earnings)

#### 2. Historical Foundation
- Models typically begin with 2-5 years of historical data
- Historical analysis provides the basis for future projections
- Trends and relationships in historical data inform forecasting assumptions

#### 3. Forecasting Methodology
- Projections typically extend 3-10 years into the future
- Assumptions should be explicit, documented, and adjustable
- Different line items require different forecasting approaches

#### 4. Flexibility
- Models should allow for easy scenario analysis
- Key assumptions should be variable and clearly identified
- Sensitivity analysis should be built into the model structure

#### 5. Clarity and Transparency
- Clear labeling and consistent formatting
- Separation of inputs, calculations, and outputs
- Documentation of assumptions and methodologies

## Building a Three-Statement Financial Model

### Step 1: Set Up the Model Structure

- Projection periods (typically 3-10 years)
- Clear labeling of actual vs. projected data

#### Worksheet Organization
- Assumptions sheet for key inputs
- Historical data sheet
- Projection sheets for each financial statement
- Supporting schedules (debt, depreciation, working capital, etc.)
- Summary dashboard and outputs

#### Formatting Conventions
- Consistent color coding (e.g., blue for inputs, black for calculations)
- Clear headers and labels
- Consistent sign convention (negative numbers for outflows)
- Appropriate decimal places and number formatting

### Step 2: Input Historical Data

#### Income Statement
- Revenue by segment or product line
- Cost of goods sold and gross profit
- Operating expenses
- Non-operating items
- Income taxes
- Net income and EPS

#### Balance Sheet
- Current assets and liabilities
- Property, plant, and equipment
- Intangible assets

- Profitability margins (gross, EBITDA, net)
- Efficiency ratios (asset turnover, inventory days)
- Liquidity and solvency ratios

#### Identify Trends and Relationships
- Revenue growth patterns
- Margin expansion or contraction
- Working capital efficiency
- Capital expenditure intensity
- Dividend payout patterns

#### Benchmark Against Industry
