                <h2 id="definition">Definition and Overview</h2>
                <p>Investment banking is a specialized division of banking focused on creating capital for companies, governments, and other entities. Investment banks underwrite new debt and equity securities for all types of corporations, aid in the sale of securities, and help to facilitate mergers and acquisitions, reorganizations, and broker trades for both institutions and private investors.</p>
                
                <p>Unlike commercial banks that primarily take deposits and make loans, investment banks specialize in complex financial transactions. They serve as intermediaries between issuers of securities and the investing public, helping companies access the capital markets to raise money for expansion or other needs.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Investment banking is the business of raising capital for companies and providing advising services on financing and merger activities."
                </blockquote>

                <h2 id="history">Historical Development</h2>
                <p>The modern investment banking industry traces its roots to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the United States and Europe. Firms like J.P. Morgan & Co. played pivotal roles in financing major industrial projects and corporate consolidations during America's industrial revolution.</p>
                
                <p>A significant milestone in the industry's development was the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which separated commercial banking from investment banking in the United States following the 1929 stock market crash. This separation remained in place until the repeal of key provisions by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, which allowed commercial banks to re-enter investment banking activities.</p>

                <p>The industry has undergone significant transformations in recent decades, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Globalization of financial markets</li>
                    <li>Technological advancements changing trading and analysis methods</li>
                    <li>Increased regulation following the 2008 financial crisis</li>
                    <li>Consolidation through mergers and acquisitions</li>
                    <li>Emergence of boutique and specialized investment banks</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="role">Role in Financial Markets</h2>
                <p>Investment banks play several crucial roles in the financial ecosystem:</p>
                
                <h3>Capital Formation</h3>
                <p>Investment banks help companies raise capital by issuing stocks or bonds. This process, known as underwriting, involves purchasing securities from the issuing company and then selling them to investors. This function is essential for economic growth as it enables businesses to fund expansion, research and development, acquisitions, and other strategic initiatives.</p>
                
                <h3>Market Making</h3>
                <p>Many investment banks act as market makers, providing liquidity to financial markets by standing ready to buy and sell securities. This activity helps ensure that investors can execute trades efficiently and at fair prices.</p>
                
                <h3>Advisory Services</h3>
                <p>Investment banks provide strategic advice to corporations on mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, and other financial matters. Their expertise in valuation, negotiation, and transaction structuring helps clients optimize outcomes in complex financial situations.</p>
                
                <h3>Research and Analysis</h3>
                <p>Investment banks employ research analysts who study companies, industries, and economic trends to provide insights to clients and support investment decisions. This research contributes to market efficiency by helping investors make informed decisions.</p>

                <img src="img/investment_banking_ecosystem.jpg" alt="Investment Banking Ecosystem">

                <h2 id="services">Key Services</h2>
                <p>Investment banks offer a wide range of services to corporate, institutional, and government clients:</p>
                
                <h3>Underwriting</h3>
                <p>Investment banks underwrite securities issuances, which involves purchasing newly issued stocks or bonds from companies and then selling them to investors. This process can be conducted on a firm commitment basis (where the bank purchases all securities and assumes full risk) or on a best efforts basis (where the bank agrees to sell as many securities as possible without purchasing them upfront).</p>
                
                <h3>Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)</h3>
                <p>Investment banks advise clients on mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, and other corporate restructurings. Services include target identification, valuation analysis, deal structuring, negotiation support, and transaction execution. M&A advisory is typically one of the most prestigious and profitable activities for investment banks.</p>
                
                <h3>Sales and Trading</h3>
                <p>Investment banks facilitate the buying and selling of securities for institutional clients. Sales teams maintain relationships with investors and match them with appropriate investment opportunities, while trading desks execute transactions and may take proprietary positions in various markets.</p>
                
                <h3>Equity and Debt Capital Markets</h3>
                <p>These specialized teams focus on helping companies raise capital through public offerings or private placements of equity and debt securities. They advise on timing, pricing, and structuring of offerings to optimize outcomes for issuers.</p>
                
                <h3>Structured Finance</h3>
                <p>Investment banks create complex financial instruments by packaging assets (such as mortgages, loans, or receivables) into securities that can be sold to investors. This process, known as securitization, helps distribute risk and provides liquidity to markets.</p>
                
                <h3>Risk Management</h3>
                <p>Investment banks help clients manage various financial risks through derivatives and other financial instruments. These solutions can address interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk, and other exposures that clients face in their operations.</p>
