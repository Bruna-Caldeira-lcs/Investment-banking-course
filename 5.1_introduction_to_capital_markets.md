# Introduction to Capital Markets

## Introduction

Capital markets are the financial markets where companies raise long-term capital through the issuance of securities, and where these securities are subsequently traded among investors. Investment banks play a crucial role in capital markets by facilitating the issuance of securities and providing liquidity to the markets. This section explores the structure, participants, and functions of capital markets, as well as the role of investment banks in these markets.

## Structure of Capital Markets

Capital markets are broadly divided into two main categories: primary markets and secondary markets.

### Primary Markets

Primary markets are where new securities are issued and sold to investors for the first time:

#### Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)
- First-time issuance of shares to the public
- Transition from private to public company status
- Typically involves significant regulatory requirements
- Usually includes both primary shares (new shares issued by the company) and secondary shares (existing shares sold by current shareholders)

#### Follow-On Offerings
- Additional issuance of equity by already-public companies
- Can be used to raise capital for expansion, acquisitions, or debt repayment
- May include primary shares, secondary shares, or both
- Generally less complex than IPOs due to existing public company infrastructure

#### Debt Issuances
- Corporate bonds and notes
- Government bonds
- Asset-backed securities
- Structured products
- Convertible securities

#### Private Placements
- Securities sold directly to qualified institutional buyers or accredited investors
- Exempt from many public offering registration requirements
- Often used by private companies or for specialized securities
- Typically involves less regulatory scrutiny but more limited investor base

### Secondary Markets

Secondary markets are where existing securities are bought and sold among investors:

#### Stock Exchanges
- Organized marketplaces for trading equity securities
- Examples: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange (LSE)
- Provide liquidity, price discovery, and regulatory oversight
- May specialize in different types of companies (e.g., large-cap, technology)

#### Over-the-Counter (OTC) Markets
- Decentralized dealer networks for trading securities not listed on exchanges
- Examples: OTC Markets Group (OTCQX, OTCQB, Pink Sheets)
- Generally less regulated than exchanges
- Often used for smaller companies, ADRs, or specialized securities

#### Bond Markets
- Government bond markets (Treasuries, municipals)
- Corporate bond markets
- Largely OTC rather than exchange-traded
- Typically institutional investor-dominated
- Less transparent than equity markets

#### Alternative Trading Systems
- Electronic communication networks (ECNs)
- Dark pools
- Crossing networks
- Provide alternatives to traditional exchanges
- Often focus on minimizing market impact or transaction costs
