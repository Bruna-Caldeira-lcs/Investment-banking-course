4. Verify that your data is accurate by cross-checking totals and ensuring that the balance sheet equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) holds true.

## Part 2: Ratio Calculation and Analysis (45 minutes)

Using the data you've extracted, calculate the following ratios for both fiscal years:

### Liquidity Ratios
1. Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities
2. Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities
3. Cash Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents) ÷ Current Liabilities

### Profitability Ratios
4. Gross Margin = Gross Profit ÷ Revenue
5. Operating Margin = Operating Income ÷ Revenue
6. Net Profit Margin = Net Income ÷ Revenue
7. Return on Assets (ROA) = Net Income ÷ Average Total Assets
8. Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income ÷ Average Shareholders' Equity

### Efficiency Ratios
9. Asset Turnover = Revenue ÷ Average Total Assets
10. Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory
11. Days Sales Outstanding = (Accounts Receivable ÷ Revenue) × 365
12. Days Inventory Outstanding = (Inventory ÷ Cost of Goods Sold) × 365

### Leverage Ratios
13. Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt ÷ Total Equity
14. Debt-to-Assets Ratio = Total Debt ÷ Total Assets
15. Interest Coverage Ratio = Operating Income ÷ Interest Expense

### Valuation Ratios
16. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio = Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share
17. Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA = Enterprise Value ÷ EBITDA
18. Price-to-Book Ratio = Stock Price ÷ Book Value Per Share

## Part 3: Comparative Analysis (30 minutes)

1. Compare Apple's ratios between 2022 and 2023 to identify trends and changes in financial performance.

2. Compare Apple's ratios to the industry averages provided in the "Industry_Benchmarks.xlsx" file.

3. Create at least three charts or graphs that visually represent the most significant findings from your analysis.

## Part 4: Interpretation and Conclusions (45 minutes)

Based on your analysis, write a 500-word report addressing the following questions:

1. How has Apple's financial performance changed from 2022 to 2023? Identify and explain the most significant changes.

2. How does Apple's financial performance compare to industry benchmarks? In which areas does the company outperform or underperform its peers?

3. What are Apple's key financial strengths and weaknesses based on your ratio analysis?

4. What recommendations would you make to improve Apple's financial performance?

5. As an investment banking analyst, would you consider Apple financially healthy? Would you recommend it as an investment? Why or why not?

## Part 5: Presentation (Optional)

Prepare a brief presentation (5-7 slides) summarizing your findings and recommendations. Your presentation should include:

1. An overview of Apple's financial performance
2. Key ratio analysis with visual aids
3. Comparison to industry benchmarks
4. Strengths and weaknesses identified
5. Recommendations for improvement
6. Investment recommendation
