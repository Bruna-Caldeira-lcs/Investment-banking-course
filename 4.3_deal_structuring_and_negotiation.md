# Deal Structuring and Negotiation

## Introduction

Deal structuring and negotiation are critical phases in the M&A process that determine how a transaction is organized and the specific terms under which it will be completed. The structure of a deal affects its tax implications, regulatory requirements, risk allocation, and ultimately its success in creating value. This section explores the key considerations, strategies, and techniques involved in structuring and negotiating M&A transactions.

## Transaction Structures

The choice of transaction structure has significant implications for both buyers and sellers:

### Stock Purchases

In a stock purchase, the buyer acquires the target company's stock directly from its shareholders:

#### Key Characteristics
- Target becomes a subsidiary of the acquirer or is merged
- All assets and liabilities are acquired, including unknown liabilities
- Contractual relationships typically remain intact
- Tax basis of assets remains unchanged

#### Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Entire company transfers with stock ownership
- **Continuity**: Business operations continue uninterrupted
- **Contract Preservation**: Avoids need to assign contracts
- **Permits and Licenses**: Often remain in place

#### Disadvantages
- **Unknown Liabilities**: Buyer assumes all liabilities, including undisclosed ones
- **Shareholder Approval**: Typically requires approval from target shareholders
- **Tax Considerations**: No step-up in tax basis of assets for buyer
- **Minority Shareholders**: May need to address holdouts

### Asset Purchases

In an asset purchase, the buyer acquires specific assets (and possibly liabilities) from the target:

#### Key Characteristics
- Buyer selects which assets and liabilities to acquire
- Target company continues to exist as a separate entity
- Contracts, permits, and licenses may need to be transferred
- Tax basis of assets is typically reset to purchase price

#### Advantages
- **Liability Selection**: Buyer can leave certain liabilities behind
- **Asset Selection**: Buyer can choose specific assets to acquire
- **Tax Benefits**: Step-up in tax basis of assets for buyer
- **Avoid Shareholder Approval**: May not require target shareholder approval

#### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: More complex to execute than stock purchase
- **Transfer Requirements**: Contracts, permits, and licenses may require consent to transfer
- **Tax Implications**: Potentially higher tax burden for seller
- **Bulk Sales Laws**: May trigger additional legal requirements

### Mergers

A merger involves the combination of two companies into one legal entity:

#### Forward Merger
- Target company merges into acquirer
- Acquirer survives, target ceases to exist
- Target shareholders receive consideration directly
- All assets and liabilities transfer by operation of law

#### Reverse Merger
- Acquirer merges into target company
- Target survives, acquirer ceases to exist
- Useful for preserving target's contracts, licenses, etc.
- Often used when target has valuable non-transferable assets

#### Triangular Merger
- Target merges with acquirer's subsidiary
- Can be forward (target into subsidiary) or reverse (subsidiary into target)
- Isolates liabilities from parent company
- Allows use of acquirer's stock as consideration while maintaining separation

#### Advantages of Mergers
- **Legal Simplicity**: Assets and liabilities transfer by operation of law
- **Shareholder Approval**: Typically requires only majority approval
- **Squeeze-Out**: Minority shareholders can be forced out
- **Continuity**: Business operations continue uninterrupted

#### Disadvantages of Mergers
- **All Liabilities**: All liabilities transfer to surviving entity
- **Shareholder Approval**: Still requires target shareholder approval
- **Regulatory Scrutiny**: May face greater regulatory review
- **Dissenter's Rights**: Shareholders may have appraisal rights

## Consideration Structures

The form of consideration paid in an M&A transaction has significant implications for both parties:

### Cash Consideration

#### Characteristics
- Fixed value to seller
- Clean exit for selling shareholders
- Immediate taxable event for sellers
- Buyer bears all post-closing risk

#### Advantages for Buyer
- Simplicity in transaction structure
- No dilution of existing shareholders
- Clear control of target post-closing
- No ongoing relationship with sellers

#### Advantages for Seller
- Certainty of value
- Immediate liquidity
- No exposure to buyer's future performance
- Simplicity in distribution to multiple shareholders

#### Financing Considerations
- Cash on hand
- Debt financing
- Equity raises to fund cash payment
- Impact on balance sheet and credit metrics

### Stock Consideration

#### Characteristics
- Value fluctuates with acquirer's stock price
- Sellers become shareholders in combined entity
- Potential tax deferral for sellers
- Sellers retain some risk/upside in combined company

#### Fixed Exchange Ratio
- Fixed number of acquirer shares for each target share
- Value to target shareholders varies with acquirer's stock price
- Aligns interests in period between signing and closing
- Simplifies documentation and negotiation

#### Fixed Value (Floating Exchange Ratio)
- Fixed dollar value of acquirer shares for each target share
- Exchange ratio adjusted at closing based on acquirer's stock price
- Provides value certainty to target shareholders
- Shifts pre-closing market risk to acquirer

#### Collar Arrangements
- Combination of fixed exchange ratio with upper/lower bounds
- Protects both parties from extreme stock price movements
- Can include walk-away rights if price moves beyond certain thresholds
- Balances certainty and risk-sharing

#### Advantages for Buyer
- Conservation of cash
- Shared risk with sellers
- Potential tax advantages
- May be easier to finance large transactions

#### Advantages for Seller
- Tax deferral potential
- Participation in future upside
- Potentially higher overall valuation
- Continued investment in the business

### Mixed Consideration

#### Cash and Stock Combination
- Portion of consideration in cash, portion in stock
- Balances certainty and upside participation
- Allows tax planning flexibility for sellers
- Can address different seller preferences

#### Contingent Consideration (Earnouts)
- Additional payments based on future performance
- Bridges valuation gaps between buyer and seller
- Typically tied to financial or operational metrics
- Structured as cash payments or additional stock

#### Advantages
- Addresses valuation uncertainties
- Aligns incentives post-closing
- Facilitates deals where parties disagree on valuation
- Can reduce upfront financing requirements

#### Disadvantages
- Complexity in structure and documentation
- Potential for post-closing disputes
- May create misaligned incentives
- Accounting and tax complications

## Tax Considerations in Deal Structuring

Tax implications significantly influence transaction structure and can dramatically affect the net proceeds to sellers and post-transaction returns for buyers:

### Taxable Transactions

#### Asset Purchases
- Seller: Tax on gain from each asset sold (ordinary income and capital gains)
- Buyer: Step-up in tax basis of acquired assets
- Depreciation/amortization benefits for buyer
- Double taxation for C corporations (corporate and shareholder level)

#### Stock Purchases (Taxable)
- Seller: Capital gains tax on stock sale
- Buyer: No step-up in asset basis unless Section 338 election made
- Section 338 election: Treated as asset purchase for tax purposes
- Trade-off between seller tax cost and buyer tax benefits

### Tax-Free or Tax-Deferred Transactions

#### Tax-Free Reorganizations
- Requires significant portion of consideration in acquirer stock
- Sellers defer tax until they sell acquirer shares
- Buyer does not receive step-up in asset basis
- Various forms under Internal Revenue Code (A, B, C reorganizations)
